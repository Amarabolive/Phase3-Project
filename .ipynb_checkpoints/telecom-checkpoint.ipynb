    "The goal is to identify and predict patterns and factors that contribute to customer churn, helping telecom companies improve retention strategies. This allows the business to intervene early and potentially reduce customer loss, hence saving revenue. The audience is the telecom business. The telecom business is interested in reducing income as a result of customers not sticking around for long. \n",
