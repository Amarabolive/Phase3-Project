# Phase3-Project
## Project Overview
This project will engage in the full data science process from start to finish, solving a classification problem using a telecom_churn.csv. This dataset contains information on 3,333 telecom customers and is intended for use in customer churn analysis and prediction. Churn refers to customers who have stopped using the service. The goal is to identify patterns and factors that contribute to customer churn, helping telecom companies improve retention strategies.
## Business Understanding
The goal is to identify and predict patterns and factors that contribute to customer churn, helping telecom companies improve retention strategies. This allows the business to intervene early and potentially reduce customer loss, hence saving revenue. 
The audience is the telecom business. The telecom business is interested in reducing income as a result of customers not sticking around for long. 

## Question: How accurate is the churn prediction model in identifying customers who are likely to leave?

Analytics/KPIs:

* Model Accuracy / Precision / Recall / F1 Score

* ROC-AUC Score (overall model performance)

* Confusion Matrix (True Positives, False Positives, etc.)

* Lift and Gain Charts (effectiveness of the model at different thresholds)
* ## Data Understanding
## Exploratory Data Analysis: Telecom_Churn 

## üìå Objective
To develop a predictive model for customer churn in a telecom company, aiming to accurately classify whether a customer is likely to leave or stay.

## . üóÇÔ∏è Data Overview
- Import necessary libraries
- Load the dataset
- Clean the dataset
- Split into features and target
- Train Random Forest classifier
- Plot Confusion Matrix
- Visualization
- ## Iterative Approach to Modeling
Will demonstrate an iterative approach to modeling. This means building multiple models. Begining with a basic model, evaluating it, and then providing justification for and proceed to a new model.

Model features and preprocessing approaches
Different kinds of models (logistic regression, decision trees, etc.)
Different model hyperparameters

### The project will build two models
* A simple interpretable baseline model (logistic regression or simple decision tree,
* A version of the simple model with tuned hyperparameters.
